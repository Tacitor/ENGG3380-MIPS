8. Suppose the program counter (PC) is set to 0x20000000.
(a) Is it possible to use the jump ( j ) MIPS assembly instruction to set the
PC to the address as 0x40000000 ?

	Ans: No because the jump instruction only has 26 bits to express the address to jump to and 0x40000000 exeeds 26 bits in binary.
	
(b) Is it possible to use the branch-on-equal (beq) MIPS assembly instruction
to set the PC to this same address?

	Ans: again not possible beacuase the beq instruction ony has 16 bits to define a memory address.
