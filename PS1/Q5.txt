Assume that registers $s0 and $s1 hold the values 0x80000000 and 0xD0000000,
respectively.

(a) What is the value of $t0 for the following assembly code? 
	add $t0, $s0, $s1
	
	Ans: Register $t0 will have a value of 0x50000000
(b) Is the result in $t0 the desired result, or has there been overflow?

	Ans: There has been overflow.

(c) For the contents of registers $ s0 and $ s1 as specified above, What is the value of $t0 for the following assembly code?
	sub $t0, $s0, $s1
	
	Ans: 0xB0000000
